# jev_pakkio

## Platform support

Run the scoring CLI and HTTP server on **Windows or Linux with PyTorch**, using
CPU or a supported GPU, or on **Apple silicon with MLX/Metal**. The default backend
is selected automatically. See [Getting started](getting-started.md) for portable
setup commands and CUDA/ROCm installation guidance.

Frozen-feature extraction, head training/evaluation, and chess LoRA training still
require Apple silicon/MLX. Published latency measurements refer to the original
Apple silicon setup, not Windows/Linux performance.


One-pass option scoring with a local Gemma 3 4B on Apple silicon via MLX.

Given a context and a list of pre-written options, the model prefills the
context once, expands that KV cache across the option batch, and scores every
option in a single padded forward pass. No decoding. The score is the
log-probability of the option tokens given the context; a softmax over the
option scores gives a probability per option, like `jevlike-predict`.

## Why it is fast

The context is encoded once and its KV cache is reused for every candidate, so
adding options costs one padded forward pass rather than one pass per option.

Measured on an M5 Pro, 64 GB (bf16, mlx-lm), with a 202-token context, 8
options and 242 option tokens in total:

| path | median latency |
|---|---|
| context cached once, options batched | 0.17 s |
| context re-encoded per option, no cache | 0.68 s |

Model load is about 1 s from a warm disk. The first forward pass adds under a
second of warm-up.

## What you can do with it

- **Rank options from the CLI** — [`jev_pakkio score`](cli.md#score) and
  [`jev_pakkio eval`](cli.md#eval) for accuracy on jevlike-style JSONL.
- **Serve it over HTTP** — [`jev_pakkio serve`](cli.md#serve) loads the model once
  and answers `POST /score` and `POST /v1/systemone`, a
  [TypeSafe System One](https://docs.typesafe.ai)-compatible contract.
- **Train a per-task head** — cache frozen-Gemma features and fit jevlike's
  cross-attention head in MLX. See [Training a head](training.md).
- **Watch it play Doom** — the server picks every action from a text
  description of the frame. See the [Doom demo](doom-demo.md).

!!! note "macOS only"
    jev_pakkio runs natively on macOS with Metal. There is no container path,
    because Linux containers cannot reach the Apple GPU.

## Python in thirty seconds

```python
from jev_pakkio import OptionScorer

s = OptionScorer("models/gemma-3-4b-it", batch_size=8)
for r in s.score("The capital of France is", [" Paris", " Berlin"], norm="mean"):
    print(r.option, r.probability, r.logprob_sum, r.n_tokens)
print(s.last_timing)
```
