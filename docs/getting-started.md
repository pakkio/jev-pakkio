# Getting started

## Requirements

- Windows or Linux for PyTorch inference (CPU or a supported GPU), or macOS on
  Apple silicon for MLX/Metal. Head training and feature extraction require MLX.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the Python 3.12 environment.
- A Hugging Face login with access to `google/gemma-3-4b-it`, which is a gated
  repository.

## Windows and Linux

From the repository root, these commands work in PowerShell and Linux shells:

```sh
uv sync
uv run hf auth login
uv run hf download google/gemma-3-4b-it --local-dir models/gemma-3-4b-it
uv run jev_pakkio serve --backend torch --device auto --port 8000
```

Accept Google's Gemma license on Hugging Face before downloading. You can instead
pass `--model google/gemma-3-4b-it` to load from the Hugging Face cache. No Make or
virtual-environment activation is required.

### GPU setup

Install your GPU driver and the appropriate PyTorch build using the
[official PyTorch installer](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Run its
installation command inside this project's environment, replacing `pip3 install`
with `uv pip install`. Use `uv run --no-sync` afterward to preserve that build.

```sh
uv run --no-sync python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.cuda.is_available())"
uv run --no-sync jev_pakkio serve --backend torch --device cuda --batch-size 2
uv run --no-sync jev_pakkio check --backend torch --device cuda
```

`--device auto` chooses CUDA, then MPS, then CPU according to availability.
`--device cuda` requires a working GPU installation and reports an error otherwise.
Use `cuda:1` to select another GPU or `cpu` to force CPU inference. Supported AMD
ROCm installations on Linux also use PyTorch's `cuda` device name.

Allow roughly 8 GB for the 4B model's 16-bit weights, plus memory for activations
and option caches. Reduce batch size or context length if GPU memory is tight.
CPU inference uses float32 and needs more RAM. PyTorch requires original Hugging
Face weights; MLX quantized checkpoints and MLX LoRA adapters are unsupported.

### Score and verify

```sh
uv run jev_pakkio score --context "The capital of France is" --option " Paris" --option " Berlin"
uv run jev_pakkio check
uv run jev_pakkio bench
```

Use `uv run --no-sync` in these examples if you installed a custom GPU build.
Scoring, evaluation, benchmarking, correctness checks, `/score`, and
`/v1/systemone` support both backends. Feature extraction, head training/evaluation,
and chess LoRA training remain MLX workflows on Apple silicon. The Doom terminal
UI has separate platform dependencies.

## Apple silicon setup

!!! warning "Xcode licence"
    `make` on macOS needs the Xcode licence accepted
    (`sudo xcodebuild -license accept`), or use Homebrew's `gmake`.

## Setup

```sh
make setup       # uv sync (arm64 Python 3.12 venv) + download google/gemma-3-4b-it into models/
```

`make setup` runs two targets:

| target | what it does |
|---|---|
| `make venv` | `uv sync --extra torch` into `.venv/` |
| `make model` | `hf download google/gemma-3-4b-it --local-dir models/gemma-3-4b-it` if it is missing |

The optional `torch` extra is installed because `make setup` asks for it; it is
used only for the jevlike comparison and Hugging Face cross-checks, not for
scoring.

Both the model directory and the Hugging Face repo id are overridable:

```sh
make setup MODEL=models/my-gemma HF_REPO=google/gemma-3-4b-it
```

## First run

Rank three options for one context:

```sh
.venv/bin/jev_pakkio score --context "The capital of France is" \
    --option " Paris" --option " Berlin" --option " Lyon"
```

Each option prints with its probability, normalised score, raw log-probability
sum, and token count. Note the leading space inside each option: options carry
their own leading whitespace rather than relying on a separator.

Check that the prefix-cached batched path agrees with naive re-encoding, then
benchmark it:

```sh
make check       # verify cached batched scoring against naive re-encoding
make bench       # latency benchmark
```

## Run the server

```sh
make serve       # = .venv/bin/jev_pakkio serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --model models/gemma-3-4b-it
```

In another terminal:

```sh
make health      # curl /health
make request     # example curl against /score
make systemone   # TypeSafe-style request against /v1/systemone
```

`POST /score` takes a context and a list of options:

```sh
curl -s localhost:8000/score -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "context": "Customer: my order arrived broken. Agent:",
  "options": [" I am sorry, I will send a replacement.", " Please read our returns policy."],
  "norm": "mean", "chat": false, "sep": ""
}'
```

The response has `best`, `best_index`, per-option `probability` /
`logprob_sum` / `n_tokens`, and `timing`.

### TypeSafe System One

`POST /v1/systemone` implements the request/response shape documented at
[docs.typesafe.ai](https://docs.typesafe.ai): a `state` (string, object or
array) plus a map of typed `questions`, answered against that state.

```sh
make systemone     # sends examples/systemone-quickstart.json
```

| question `type` | request `criteria` | answer fields |
|---|---|---|
| `choice` | map of option name to description (string, object, array or null); up to 255 options | `choice`, `probabilities` (sum to 1), `confidence` |
| `score` | ordered array of level descriptions | `score` (probability-weighted mean of level index), `probabilities` keyed `"0".."n-1"`, `legend`, `confidence` |
| `noul` | optional `{"true": ..., "false": ...}` | `noul` = probability of yes |

The response is
`{"model", "answers": {id: answer}, "usage": {"input_tokens", "output_tokens"}}`.
Set `OPENJEV_API_KEY` before `make serve` to require
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` on this route.

Each question is rendered to a plain-text prompt (state, instructions, options
or levels, then `Answer:` and a newline), and the option names, level numbers
or `yes`/`no` are scored as continuations in one prefix-shared batched pass per
question. `confidence` is 1 minus the normalised entropy of the distribution;
TypeSafe does not publish its formula, so treat it as an approximation.
`usage.output_tokens` counts the candidate-label tokens that were scored.

!!! note "Zero-shot probabilities are not calibrated"
    On the docs' quick-start request, Gemma 3 4B zero-shot reaches the same
    routing decision as Jev but is markedly over-confident and disagrees on
    judgement calls. Softmaxed next-token likelihoods are not calibrated
    judgements — closing the gap means labelled data and a
    [trained head](training.md).

## Evaluate on your own data

```sh
make eval DATA=data/synthetic/test.jsonl
```

Rows are jevlike-style JSONL: `{"context": ..., "options": [...], "label": 0}`.
See the [CLI reference](cli.md#eval) for the full set of flags.

## Cleaning up

```sh
make clean       # remove runs/ and __pycache__, keeping the venv and the model
```
